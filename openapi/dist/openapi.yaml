    # Introduction


    This API definition is intended to be a good starting point to describe this
    application



    # OpenAPI Specification


    The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard,

    language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which


    allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities

    of the service without access to source


    code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly

    defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can


    understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of

    implementation logic. Similar to what


    interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the

    guesswork in calling the service.
